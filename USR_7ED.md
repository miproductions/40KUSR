###Glossary

* 7RB[D]: 7th Edition Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook [Digital]. References dates should be the publication date for hardcover rules, or the actual date referenced for Digital (as Digital can stealth update).
* IAn[.2] Forge World Imperial Armour n [2nd Edition]


###Editing

* All rules must be in alphabetical order.
* Reference precedence is chronological. In the event of conflict, FAQ > Codex > IA > BRB.
* GW uses British English spelling (e.g. armour not armor) so we do as well.
